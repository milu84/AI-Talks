# Example Topics for AI Talks

Below are several example topics you can use with AI Talks. Each includes a title and description that you can copy to your `topic.txt` file.

## Technology & AI

### Artificial General Intelligence: Promise or Peril?
As AI systems become more capable, we approach the possibility of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) - AI that can perform any intellectual task that a human can. What are the potential benefits of AGI for humanity? What existential risks might it pose? Discuss the technological hurdles, the ethical considerations, and how society might adapt to a world with AGI. Should we be accelerating or slowing its development?

### Digital Privacy in the Age of AI
As AI systems collect and analyze more of our personal data, how should we redefine privacy rights and expectations? Consider the balance between convenience and privacy, the role of government regulation versus corporate responsibility, and whether certain types of data deserve special protection. How can individuals maintain control over their digital footprints while still benefiting from personalized services?

## Society & Governance

### Universal Basic Income: Necessity or Misguided Policy?
As automation changes the nature of work, some propose a Universal Basic Income (UBI) where all citizens receive a regular stipend regardless of employment status. Would UBI promote creativity and entrepreneurship by providing economic security, or would it discourage productivity and create unsustainable government expenditure? How might such a program be funded and implemented? What real-world examples and experiments with UBI can inform this discussion?

### Reimagining Education for the 21st Century
Our education systems were largely designed for the industrial age. How should we transform education to prepare students for a world of automation, rapid change, and information abundance? Consider changes to curriculum, teaching methods, assessment, the role of technology, and the balance between specialized skills and general capabilities. What successful educational innovations worldwide could provide models for broader reform?

## Environment & Future

### Geoengineering: Last Resort or Reckless Gamble?
As climate change accelerates, some scientists propose large-scale interventions like solar radiation management or carbon capture to modify Earth's climate system. What are the potential benefits and risks of such approaches? Who should make decisions about deploying these technologies? What governance structures would be needed? Discuss the ethical dimensions of deliberately manipulating the planet's systems versus the ethical implications of inaction.

### Space Colonization: Destiny or Distraction?
As private and public entities pursue ambitious plans for lunar bases, Mars missions, and beyond, should we embrace space colonization as humanity's future? Does establishing a multi-planetary civilization represent a necessary insurance policy against extinction, or does it distract from solving pressing problems on Earth? Consider the technical challenges, ethical questions about resource allocation, and how space exploration might affect human society and identity.

## Philosophy & Ethics

### Consciousness in Non-Human Entities
As our understanding of consciousness evolves, how should we approach the possibility of consciousness in animals, advanced AI systems, or even complex biological systems? What ethical responsibilities would we have toward conscious non-human entities? Discuss how we might recognize or measure consciousness in other beings, and how our definitions of consciousness influence our moral frameworks.

### The Ethics of Genetic Enhancement
Advances in gene editing technologies like CRISPR make it increasingly possible to enhance human capabilities beyond treating disease. Should we embrace genetic enhancements that could improve intelligence, physical performance, or longevity? What limits, if any, should be placed on these technologies? Consider issues of access, consent, diversity, and the meaning of human identity in an age where our genetic code becomes malleable.

## Health & Biotechnology

### Longevity Science: Blessing or Burden?
Scientists are making progress in understanding and potentially slowing the aging process. What would be the societal implications if human lifespans were significantly extended? Consider impacts on population, resources, career patterns, family structures, and psychological well-being. Would radical life extension increase inequality or provide new opportunities to solve humanity's problems? How would longer lives change our relationship with time and meaning?

### The Future of Mental Health Treatment
Mental health conditions affect billions worldwide, yet treatment approaches have evolved relatively slowly compared to other medical fields. How might emerging technologies like neurostimulation, psychedelics, AI therapy, and personalized medicine transform mental healthcare? What are the promises and limitations of biological versus psychosocial approaches? Consider how cultural factors influence mental health treatment and how future approaches might be more culturally responsive.

## Economics & Business

### Cryptocurrency and the Future of Money
Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology present alternatives to traditional financial systems. Will digital currencies eventually replace conventional money, remain niche alternatives, or evolve into something else entirely? Discuss the potential benefits (financial inclusion, reduced friction, privacy) against drawbacks (environmental impacts, volatility, enabling illicit activity). How might governments, central banks, and financial institutions adapt?

### Rethinking Corporate Responsibility in a Global Economy
As corporations grow in power and influence, how should we reconceive their responsibilities to society beyond maximizing shareholder value? Consider stakeholder capitalism, ESG investing, benefit corporations, and other models that expand corporate accountability. Discuss how these approaches might address issues like inequality, environmental degradation, and community well-being. Can voluntary corporate responsibility replace government regulation?
