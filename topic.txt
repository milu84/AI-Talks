Universal Basic Income: Necessity or Misguided Policy?

As automation changes the nature of work, some propose a Universal Basic Income (UBI) where all citizens receive a regular stipend regardless of employment status. Would UBI promote creativity and entrepreneurship by providing economic security, or would it discourage productivity and create unsustainable government expenditure? How might such a program be funded and implemented? What real-world examples and experiments with UBI can inform this discussion?
